# Weekly report 6

This week I finally got the row solving algorithm to a working state. I have not yet tested it enough to determine wheter there are any bugs left or nor ot how effectively it works, so that is what I have to continue from the next time I work on the project.

This time I used all of the time on finnishing the row solver. There was quite lot of stuff to debug so I did not have time to work on other things. (I am writing this report sometime before finishing the day's work so it is possible that I might still have a little bit of time to write some documentation.)

As the next thing I am going to make some proper testing for the RowSolver. After that I will make a simple ChartSolver. I will also have to remember to write the missing documentation and optimize the algorithm. I will think about what kind of UI I have time to make after getting the program working as a whole.

As the final delivery is quite late on this course, I should have time to work on the project after the my other courses finish.

Time used this week: 7 h 30 min
