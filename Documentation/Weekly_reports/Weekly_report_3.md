# Weekly report 3

This week I finished working on the data structures needed for handling nonograms. Chart class for the entire nonogram chart was finished. Row class, which is meant as the basic data to be used for the recursive solving algorithm was also finished, aside from one missing JUnit test I want to make. Chart class rows can now be converted to Row class objects and Row class objects can now be divided to smaller parts to new Row class objects.

I have not advanced as much I would have wanted. I would have wanted to start working on the algorithms or UI but I did not spend as much time on the project as I would have wanted to. Also, the time I spent, I worked quite slowly. Quite large part of the time was spent on working on testing and javadoc documentation.

Again, I have not learnt many new things this week as I have mostly worked on relatively basic classes. The few things I learned were about using JUnit. Because of this and the fact that CircleCI and Codecov were cooperative this time I did not have any significant difficulties this week.

I will start the next week by adding the missing test for Row class. Then I am going to plan in which order I am going to do the work on algorithms and UI.

Time used this week: 6 h 30 min
