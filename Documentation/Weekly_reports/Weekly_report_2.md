# Weekly report 2

This week the biggest problem was my CircleCI configuration still not working. I spent around half of the working time on that. Eventually I managed to fix the problem by changin the directory structure of the project. I also set up Codecov, but it does not seem to be working consistantly.

After dealing with the configurations, I started working on the code. I opted to start from making the structures necessary for the program to handle nonogram charts. A class and a test class for saving number values for a nonogram row should be finihed but there still is work to be done on the nonogram chart. I also had to make a way to easily view nonogram charts during testing, which required some time.

I do not think I learned anything new this week, aside from configurating CircleCI, Codecov  and Checkstyle. The things I worked on were relatively basic, so I did not need study about things related to Java and algorithms.

As the next thing I am going to finish the data structures need for handling nongram charts. After that I start working on the graphical user-interface and on a simple implementation of the solving algorithm I have planned.
