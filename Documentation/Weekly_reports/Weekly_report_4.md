# Weekly report 4

This week I spent most of the time in figuring out the row solving algorithm and starting the implementation of it. Both of these took around half of my work time each. I managed to figure out a working structure for row solving algorithm by using pen and paper. Unlike my original idea, it is not based on recursion, but moving colored squares on a nonogram row.

The implementation of the algorithm is not yet finished, but it seems to be working correctly on the parts that it is ready. I have not yet made automatic testing for RowSolver, as I have wanted to work on the actual code this week and manual testing seems to be enough for now. I am planning on adding the automated testing for week 5.

At this point of the project, I do not have any problems that I could not deal with spending some time thinking about them.

I think I have worked quite hard this week, but again, not for long enough time. My goal is to spend more time on the project during Easter. As the next thing I am going to finish nonogram row solver algorithm and JUnit and Javadoc for it. After that I start working on either chart solving algorithm or UI. I also have to properly test efficency of the algorithms and write some new documentation about the algorithm at some point.

Time used this week: 6 h 20 min
