# Weekly report 5

This week I spent almost all of the time implementing the row solving algorithm. I think it is almost finished at this point, as the only thing I know that is still missing is backtracking and proper testing. I do have a plan for this already, but it is possible that I have forgot to take something in attention and there may still be a significant amount of work on row solving algorithm. After that, the rest of the project should be more straightforward, as the simple algorithm for chart solving should be just a few for loops, which then I can think of a way to make faster in some way. UI and extra features are still missing, too. Also, writing the missing documentation would be very important.

As I am making the solving algorithm myself and not basing it on an existing one, it is the most difficult part of the project. Even though I have still some uncertainity about implementing backtracking for the row solving algorithm, I think I should be able to make it work next time.

I worked more for this week than on the previous weeks but I think it still was not enough. I should have just started a bit earlier. The next time the main priority is to have a working row solving algorithm, that also has proper testing. A simple chart solver would also be good make so I could start testing efficency of my program.

Time used this week: 10 h
