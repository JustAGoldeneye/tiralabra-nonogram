# Weekly report 1

This week I spent my time setting up the repository and wrting initial documentation.
I had forgot how to set up Gradle, so I had to look that up. I also spent a lot of time trying to set up CircleCI configuration file properly, but I did not manage to get that working. The problem seems to be that I cannot get CircleCI to run the tests in sub-directories. The time spent on writing the documentation was mostly put to the definition document.

I have not yet started working on the actual program code.

What I learned was related to Gradle and CircleCI configuration. Also, writing the definition document helped me to get a better idea about the structure of the program.

The next things I will do are 1. setting up CircleCI and Codecov and 2. starting to work on implementing nonogram row checking code.

Time used this week: 6 h 45 min
